This repo contains script showing the current state of plone's github -> svn
migration.
The scripts list packages currently in one of plone's svn but not yet on
github or in another place.

The results are grouped by packages released on pypi and those not released
on pypi. Each group is then subgrouped by the year of the last commit.
